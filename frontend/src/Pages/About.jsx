            Health Fix is a healthcare management system in which a user can input their credentials, 
            which will be a username and password. If they do not have an existing account, 
            they will be prompted to create one. In the user's account, data about their health, 
            such as their height, weight, body fat percentage, health issues, allergies, 
            neurodivergence traits like autism, neurotypical, or adhd, whether they participate 
            in smoking/drugs, and other information about their general health. Based on the information 
            they input in this web application, the backend will analyse this data, and create tables in 
            their database management system showing what exercises are recommended for them, the 
            medications that are also recommended for them, and the recommended meal plans. 
            After the data given is analysed and the tables are created, the user will be taken back to 
            another front end, which will display the recommended meal plan, medications, exercises, and 
            vaccinations. The user then has an option to update his information later on or return to 
            the log-in page.. There will be a menu where there'll be a home page, the user has an 
            option to update their profile information, such as their health and login information, and a 
            page where they can go to and retrieve all the information that is recommended for them.
            In a post-pandemic world, telehealth appointments are rising for many reasons, and 
            in-person Doctor visits are becoming more limited. Healthfix fills a 
            critical gap in accessibility. It serves as a support system for people who may not have 
            regular medical care, while also promoting a culture of proactive health management for 
            everyone.
